# Market, Users, Prototype

## Understand Your Market
*Provide links to the 3 websites you explored* 

https://www.vrbo.com/
https://www.airbnb.com/
https://www.hostelworld.com/


*Briefly explain why these websites are a relevant comparison* 

VRBO and AirBnB are good comparisons because they're the two websites mentioned that Marriot Bonvoy lost a good amount of traffic to. Hostel World is a little more unique in that it's less rentals and more akin to something like a normal Marriot Bonvoy location, but in general, it is cheaper.

*List at least 10 product features*

1. Lists of locations to inspire types of trips
2. Able to sort between types of places (Apartment, Villa, BnB)
3. Special Celebrity Luxury Offers
4. Cities are organized next to other cities
5. Find places based on activities/amenities
6. Able to use google maps to find places
7. drop down menus, able to put in multiple criteria for location searching
8. Able to see user reviews
9. symbols and icons that show things such as Wifi/Pet Friendly, on the search page
10. able to see trips that people took at that location


## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*

  The user research shows that people would love more examples and ideas of vacations to take. There's a good chunk of people who don't really know where they want to go yet, more that they want to take a vacation. There as pain points on the information on screen, it seems overwhelming. Maybe more hover-over menus and less icons on screen at once.
