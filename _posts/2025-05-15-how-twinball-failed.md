# How my first real Game failed

In September 2024, some friends and I decided, as all bright-eyed college kids do, to work on a passion project together. Our very own video game. As Game Dev students at RIT, we were always working on a game (or games) for class but this one would be different. This one we would pitch to the Magic Maker Program, our on campus Game Publisher.
