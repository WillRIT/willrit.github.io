## The Foundation

I've been drawing my whole life. It's always been something I genuinely enjoyed—doodling in the margins of notebooks, sketching during meetings, creating whatever came to mind. But there was always a frustrating gap between what I could see and what I could create: I was great at copying or improving existing work, but drawing from my imagination? That was a different beast entirely.

As a designer, this limitation became increasingly apparent. When you're working on game design, product design, or any creative endeavor, the ability to quickly visualize ideas is invaluable. You need to communicate concepts, iterate rapidly, and explore possibilities without being confined to what already exists. Drawing from imagination isn't just a nice-to-have skill—it's essential.

## The Practice

I realized that the only way forward was through deliberate practice. The key insight? Start with primitives. Before I could design complex game assets or UI elements, I needed to master the fundamentals: basic shapes, forms, and how they exist in three-dimensional space.

## Understanding Perspective

The biggest challenge early on was grasping perspective. It seemed abstract and intimidating at first, but I leaned on resources like Drawabox and studying artists like Tom Fox who excel at teaching foundational drawing principles. Their systematic approaches helped me understand not just *how* to draw in perspective, but *why* it works the way it does.

As I studied the work of artists like Kim Jung Gi and Peter Han, I began to see perspective not as a rigid rule, but as a powerful tool for creating believable, compelling visuals. Their work showed me what's possible when you have strong foundational skills.

## The Real Motivation

Working on Twinball gave me concrete motivation for this journey. Carrie Stone is our incredible designer, and she brings visual polish and cohesion to our project that I deeply admire. But rather than waiting for someone else to handle all the visual work, I wanted to strengthen my own abilities. Whether it's quickly iterating on a game element, understanding character proportions, or visualizing a new mechanic, stronger drawing skills make me a more capable designer overall.

By committing to daily drawing practice, I'm not just improving my portfolio—I'm expanding my ability to think visually and bring ideas to life faster. Every sketch is a step toward closing that gap between imagination and execution.
