description: And how we made it succeed

In September 2024, some friends and I decided, as all bright-eyed college kids do, to work on a passion project together. Our very own video game. As Game Dev students at RIT, we were always working on a game (or games) for class but this one would be different. This one we would pitch to the Magic Maker Program, our on campus Game Publisher.

Based on the simple phrase 'Pinball Boss Rush', Twinball began to be worked on. The back and forth

- Focused too much on using C#, not on proper system design
- art was too all over the place, didn't know how to pace ourselves
- Didn't get feedback in time, unclear vision

How We Succeeded
- Re-factor to GDScript
- Worked on a nicer cooler flashier Level
- Changed the art style to look nicer
- Hone in on what this game was trying to do (Design Pillars)
- Edge Showcase, getting into Magic
