In September 2024, some friends and I decided, as all bright-eyed college kids do, to work on a passion project together. Our very own video game. As Game Dev students at RIT, we were always working on games for class, but this one would be different. This one we would pitch to the Magic Maker Program, our on-campus Game Publisher.

Based on the simple phrase "Pinball Boss Rush," Twinball was born.

## The Early Vision

The concept was elegant: imagine pinball, but instead of racking up points against a static board, you're dueling a boss in real-time. Two flippers on opposite sides of the screen, bosses reacting to your ball. It had potential. It was exciting. And we had no idea what we were doing.

## What Went Wrong

Looking back, the early version of Twinball had some serious problems:

### Too Focused on Technology, Not Design

We spent enormous energy optimizing C# and worrying about perfect code architecture. The problem? We were so caught up in *how* to build the game that we forgot about *what* we were building. We had elegant systems and clean code, but no clear game design underneath it all. We were builders without a blueprint.

### Art Direction All Over the Place

We didn't pace ourselves artistically. Different team members were pulling in different visual directions, and we didn't have a cohesive vision. The game looked confused—a little pixel-y here, a little flat-design there. Nothing felt like it belonged together. Players could tell immediately that we didn't know what we were making.

### Unclear Vision and Late Feedback

We didn't get meaningful feedback until late in development, and by then we'd already committed to so many decisions. Without a clear vision to guide us, we were just... making stuff. Every critique felt like it was pointing out problems in a foundation we'd already poured concrete over.

## How We Fixed It

The turning point came when we realized that *iteration* was more important than *perfection*. We needed to pivot.

### Switched to GDScript and Godot

Instead of wrestling with C#'s complexity, we switched to GDScript in the Godot engine. The result? We could iterate faster. We could see ideas come to life in real-time without fighting the tool. Sometimes the best technology choice isn't the most sophisticated—it's the one that lets you create.

### Rebuilt With a Strong Art Style

We chose a cohesive visual direction: clean, modern, with bold colors and satisfying effects. Everything was designed to feel *punchy*—every hit, every effect, every visual moment fed into a unified aesthetic. Art stopped being a collection of different ideas and became a language the game spoke fluently.

### Designed a Killer First Level

Rather than trying to be everything at once, we poured energy into one incredible level. This level became our thesis statement—it showed what Twinball could be. Flashier, more coherent, and most importantly, *fun*.

### Established Design Pillars

We sat down and asked: what is this game *really* about? We came up with core design pillars that would guide every decision going forward. Suddenly, every feature, every art choice, every mechanic had a filter: does it serve the pillars? If not, it's out.

### Got Real Feedback Early and Often

We started showing the game to people. At Edge Showcase, we put Twinball in front of real players and watched them play. We iterated on their feedback. We listened. And Magic Maker noticed.

## The Result

Twinball got into the Magic Maker Program. But more importantly, we learned something crucial: failure isn't the opposite of success, it's part of the path to it. 

The game didn't fail because we had a bad idea. It failed because we weren't disciplined about design, art direction, and communication. By fixing those fundamentals, we didn't just salvage the project—we made something we're genuinely proud of.

Sometimes the best thing that can happen to a project is for it to almost fail. Because then you learn what actually matters.
