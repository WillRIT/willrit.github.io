# Malpractice Makes Perfect

## Overview

Developed for my Spring 2024 Class, Problem Solving with Data Structures and Algorithms for Games. This project had us work in assigned teams for an entire semester to make a video game in the Monogame Framework.
The game had to utilize File I/O, a clear start-game-end cycle, and etc.
