description: My Final Project for my Level Design Class, An FPS Level made in Unreal Engine

# Unreal Engine FPS Level
This was the final project for the Level Design class I took in the Fall of 2025. This was one of my favorite classes I ever took, I learned so much about Level Design, Flow, Pacing, and Player Guidance. For the final project, we had to make a level in Unreal Engine. The level had to be an FPS level, with no textures or special assets. Just greyboxing, to prove we knew how to make a good level even if it was just a skeleton.

# Initial Design
It was hard making a level that was fun to play but also had no textures, assets, or lighting. I decided to come up with a simple concept that provided interesting rooms/areas to play with and work from there. I came up with the idea of a Archeological Dig Site that was being robbed by the player. So you start in a warehouse that you've broken into, move through a maze-like catacomb, and then run up a spiral staircase to the top of a temple to grab the artifact and escape. 

I mocked up this top down in a sketch so I could understand the flow of the level and how the player would move through it. I had to scrap the second half due to time (isn't that always the case) but I still think the level turned out pretty well. I also made a bubble chart of events to know how things would flow into each other.

# Level Development

I really enjoyed greyboxing the level, so much of my time designing levels I got so caught up in the art and lighting that I neglected the actual layout of the level. This time, I got to focus purely on the layout and flow of the level, making sure it was fun to play. I got to spend less time thinking about making the level and more time ACTUALLY making it. 

While I do wish I had made one or two more rooms, i'm really happy with how the level turned out. I got to experiment with different room shapes and sizes, as well as different enemy placements and combat scenarios. Unfortunately i was running into some bug where certain enemies wouldn't move or shoot their guns, which wasn't a fault on my end, rather it was the fault of the template we were all given. 


# Final Level
[Here's a video play through of the final level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7f_vBupLJY)! I really enjoyed making this level and I think it turned out pretty well for my first time in Unreal Engine.

# What I Learned

For this project, I learned a lot about Unreal Engine and it's level design tools. I got to mess around with BSP Geometry and other Greyboxing tools in Unreal. While I had some experience with Unreal before this class, I had never made a full level from scratch in it. I also learned a lot about level design principles, such as pacing, flow, and player guidance.
