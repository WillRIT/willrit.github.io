# Twinball
(note! this project is still in progress along with this page!)

## Overview

Currently in development, Twinball is the first game I've made solely for myself. This isn't for class or a game jam, I am developing the game out of my own passion. It is a single player Pinball Boss Rush game. I am developing the game with two close friends.


## Art Design
Working with the same art lead from Delivery Dan, I drafted up concept sketches and character designs that she would then ideate on and send back to me.
