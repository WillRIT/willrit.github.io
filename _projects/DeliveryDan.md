## Overview

This game jam took place shortly after the HoloJam. Because of this, I had learned that solo development was not something I was ready for. As such, I got together a team of four other people and we decided to work together. The theme for the jam was "Shadows" and "Transformation". 

## Design
After an initial brainstorming session on the first day, we came to the idea of making a platformer that had different powerups/mutations that lasted for a whole level. The game would follow a delivery man who was mutated against his will by a wizard who's delivery order was wrong.

The Art Lead and I then sketched up concept art for each level and the type of monsters that would show up in each world. Originally we had planned for the delivery man to take on a new form every level, but we found out that we were in over our heads. 

We started to pivot our design halfway through our time when we realized we quite simply did not have enough done.


## Final Submission

Our intial plan was to make 5 levels, but we ended up with 3. It was published to Itch.io as a web build as per the Jam's Rules. It features one 'mutation' which is Tentacle Arms. There's also a few different tracks that play during the game for the main menu, and first two levels. There's also an opening cutscene that our Art Lead animated. There's also a boss fight which as of this build, is very hard to access as it takes a lot of skill to finish the second level.

## What I Learned

I once again learned how to cut back on scope and pivot on plans when they proved to be too difficult. There werem any things we wanted for this game that we could not learn how to do in the short time frame, even with the exteneded team. I also had to properly communicate and schedule time with different programmers and artists in different time zones. I also learned how to Pair-Program better as there were multiple problems that only were capapble of being fixed when multiple people sat in a call to fix it together and communicate properly.
