## Overview

This project was done during the Global Career Accelerator 2024 Program: Web Development Track. Over the course of the two month program, we were taught the principles of Web Design, HTML/CSS, and Javascript. This culiminated in a special project developed by the firm Publicis Sapient for Hilton hotels. They wanted us to redesign their current website in order to help more people travel to places without. 

## User Research

In order to understand how to best build the project to the user's needs, Hilton gathered hundreds of surveys and interviews from travelers and hotel-users for us to analyze. These were given in the form of videos and documents. From this, I was able to put together that it seemed a big pain point for current travelers was not knowing where exactly they wanted to go, more-so just knowing a 'vibe'. There were also pain points regarding the information that was on screen. For more details on the research, feel free to click on the Repl.it Link and clicking on the MarketUsersPrototype.MD

## Prototype Deliverable

Our prototype features an immediate question, prompting the users to think about the location of their trip rather than immediately bombarding the user with information. It then creates Div Elements based off an array of locations with the attribute chosen from earlier and presents them to the user. If you click any of these elements, it also will then take you to an interactive map programmed into the website that tells you where the location you picked was.

## What Did I Learn From This Project?

This was my first big Web Design project. I got to do user research, write up needs and pain points, and then execute a design that properly addressed these points. There was a fair amount of code provided by the program runners, but the main functions (i.e making the div elements, sorting by selected location) were all me. This was an extremely fun project and I even got a certificate of completetion for it which is viewable on my LinkedIn.
