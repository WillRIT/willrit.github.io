# Voidhook

Voidhook is a 3D Platforming Fishing Game, developed over the course of the Fall 2025 Semester at RIT. Me and my team were given the task of essentially becoming a game studio and working under a producer and meeting regular sprint goals and milestones. My roles on the team were primarily as a Level Designer and UI/UX Designer, working closely with our Art Lead to make sure the game looked and felt good.

## Development Process

Our initial idea was to make Voidhook a Roguelike fishing game, where you'd be exploring different planets and running away from different types of monsters while trying to catch fish. However, after some initial prototyping and feedback from our producer, we decided to pivot the game to be more of a linear platformer with fishing elements. This allowed us to focus more on level design and creating a more polished experience.

Our development roles were pretty evenly split into two developers, two artists, and me to act as a go-between. I worked on aspects of the visual design and programmed parts of the overall user experience as well.

## Visual Design

We wanted Voidhook to take on a very industrial feel initially, and while we ended up ditching that aesthetic later on in the actual game, I still used a lot of Industrial/Rough looking patterns for the games title and UI.

## Overview
Here you can see my mockups for the Title, UI, and Game Over screen. We didn't have time to refine these further due to the tight schedule we were on, so they are as they are in game.

## Challenges
The biggest challenge for this game was definitely it's scope and our production mindset. Our producer had been new to the role, and the multiple people were new to Agile methodologies to begin with. So a lot of the project was spent figure out how to actually best divide up work and how to know when a feature was even done or how to even start.  

I was the only one with real production/industry experience, so I had to take on a lot of the responsibility of making sure we were on track and that we were actually shipping features. This was a great learning experience for me, as I got to put my knowledge to the test to see how well I could help out a team without taking on a direct leadership role. 

Our scope, as previously mentioned, had to get slashed multiple times. From the Roguelike elements being cut, to the fishing being completely different to how it was in the final game, to the artstyle of the game as well. We wanted to make it so there was a forest leading into a more industrial area, but we just didn't have the time or resources to make that happen, so as it stands the full game just takes place in the forest.


## Final Product
The final product consists of a short 2 level platforming experience, where you go find fish and avoid monsters. Fishing works by hitting a random order of arrow keys, similar to Helldivers 2 Stratagems. The game ends when you catch a certain number of fish and return them to your ship to fuel your way home. There's also a game over screen and an opening cutscene to help set the stage. 

## What I Learned

I learned how to use Unity more, how to make UI Components in that engine, and how to work with a more inexperienced team.
